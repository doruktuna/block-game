# Block Game

A simple block placing game developed as part of a job interview.
- You have to fill a 2D square grid with different shapes of objects.
- You can drag objects and they will snap to grid.
- Levels are generated procedurally.
- The goal platform is mobile devices but it works on computers too.

## To-Do List (See Issues)
1. Level generator uses unity tools. It should work without any dependence on Unity.
1. Level generation demo is almost the same as level generation code. They should be merged and updated.
1. Add some screenshots to readme file.
